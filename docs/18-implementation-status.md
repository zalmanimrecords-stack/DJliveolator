# 18 — Implementation Status (living map)

> **Purpose:** a single, authoritative map of what is **already built** in code, so work is
> not duplicated and so the design docs (numbered 00–17) can stay aspirational while this doc
> tracks reality. Update this file whenever a module lands. Last updated: **2026-06-05**.

## How to read this

- **Layer rule:** platform-agnostic seams + pure logic live in `Liveolator.Core` and are
  unit-tested under `tests/Liveolator.Core.Tests` with **no hardware and no native deps**.
  Native/realtime implementations live in binding projects (`Liveolator.Audio`,
  `Liveolator.Visuals`, the future `Liveolator.Midi`). This mirrors the existing
  `IFileEnumerator` / `IAudioDecoder` pattern.
- **Done** = implemented **and** covered by tests. **Deferred** = intentionally not built yet,
  with the blocker named.

## Core test count

`tests/Liveolator.Core.Tests` — **181 passing** (as of 2026-06-05).

## Module status

### ✅ Performance Action system — `Liveolator.Core/Actions/` (doc 04)

The action-layer seam: every input source drives engines through one dispatcher.

| Built | File |
|-------|------|
| Action model (serializable record + enums) | `PerformanceAction`, `PerformanceActionKind`, `ActionInputMode` |
| Feedback model | `ActionFeedbackState`, `ActionFeedbackChanged` |
| Dispatcher seam + impl | `IPerformanceActionDispatcher`, `PerformanceActionDispatcher` |
| Handler seam + base | `IPerformanceActionHandler`, `PerformanceActionHandlerBase` |
| UI-thread marshaling seam | `IActionFeedbackSynchronizer`, `InlineActionFeedbackSynchronizer` |

- Routing is **data, via handler registration** (no giant switch); duplicate-kind ownership
  fails fast at construction. Handler failures are logged with action context and swallowed;
  unknown kinds log a warning, never throw.
- **Deferred:** the concrete concern handlers (Transport, Visual, Deck, Mixer, Playlist) land
  with their engines. **`BeatActionHandler` is built** (see Beat).

### ✅ Controller mapping engine — `Liveolator.Core/Mapping/` (doc 05)

Pure MIDI→`PerformanceAction` translation + device seams + routing. **Library-agnostic.**

| Built | File |
|-------|------|
| Library-agnostic message + binding model | `MidiMessage`, `MidiMessageType`, `ControllerBinding`, `ControllerMappingProfile`, `ValueCurve`, `RelativeEncoding` |
| Value conversion (absolute+curve, 3 relative encodings, 14-bit pitch bend, velocity) | `ControlValueConverter` |
| Matching (NoteOn-vel0=NoteOff, pitch-bend per-channel) | `BindingMatcher` |
| Mapper → dispatcher | `IControllerMapper`, `ControllerMapper` |
| Conflict detection (no silent winner) | `MappingConflict`, `MappingConflictDetector` |
| MIDI learn (deterministic, user-overridable) | `IMidiLearnSession`, `MidiLearnSession` |
| Device seams | `IMidiInput`, `IMidiOutput`, `IMidiDeviceProvider` |
| Input routing (learn-aware) | `MidiControllerRouter` |
| Auto-select profile by device name | `MidiProfileSelector` |
| Action feedback → LED output | `MidiFeedbackPublisher` |

- **Deferred:** the **native MIDI implementation** of `IMidiInput`/`IMidiOutput`/
  `IMidiDeviceProvider` (a `Liveolator.Midi` project). Blocker: needs the MIDI library +
  hardware; not unit-testable. **Decision:** RtMidi/libremidi (per root `CLAUDE.md`) — note
  doc 05's body still names DryWetMidi and is pending revision; the seams above don't care.

### ✅ Beat engine primitives — `Liveolator.Core/Beat/` (doc 03)

The shared audio/visual clock foundation that needs no audio frames.

| Built | File |
|-------|------|
| Output state + seam | `BeatClockState`, `TempoCandidate`, `BeatClockSource`, `IBeatClock` |
| Link-style timeline (host-time↔beat bijection) | `IBeatTimeline`, `BeatTimeline` |
| Quantization | `Quantize`, `IBeatScheduler` (seam), `BeatQuantizer` (resolver) |
| Tap tempo (pure) | `TapTempoService` |
| Manual clock (`BeatClockSource.Manual`) | `ManualBeatClock`, `IBeatClockControl` |
| Host-time seam | `IHostClock`, `SystemHostClock` |
| **First real dispatcher handler** | `BeatActionHandler` (Tap/Lock/Unlock/Half/Double/Nudge±/Reset/SetDownbeat + lock LED feedback) |

- **End-to-end loop proven in tests:** `PerformanceActionDispatcher` → `BeatActionHandler` →
  `ManualBeatClock`, with feedback back through the dispatcher.
- **Deferred:** realtime `OnsetDetectionEngine` / audio `TempoEstimator` / `BeatTracker` /
  audio-driven `BeatClockService`. Blocker: the doc 02 audio frame pipeline, which needs an
  `IAudioSource` (gated on the audio-library decision). Also deferred: `BeatClockSource.External`
  (Ableton Link). Note: **offline** BPM/key analysis already exists under `Core/Analysis/`.

## Pre-existing Core (built before this status doc)

- `Core/Dsp/` (FFT, windows), `Core/Analysis/` (offline BPM, chroma, key/Camelot, cues),
  `Core/Library/` (incremental scan, music + visual catalogs), `Core/Playlist/`
  (`HarmonicSetBuilder`). Bindings: `Liveolator.Audio` (WAV + FFmpeg-CLI decode),
  `Liveolator.Platform` (file enumerator), `Liveolator.Visuals` (image/video probes only),
  `Liveolator.Media` (JSON catalog store), `Liveolator.Mcp` (music-intelligence server).

## Cross-cutting decisions made while building the above

- `Liveolator.Core` now references **`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions`** (abstractions
  only — keeps Core pure managed) to satisfy the mandatory-logging standard. Concrete providers
  are wired in host projects.
- All new seams follow the **immutable-record-for-state / interface-for-behavior** style and
  inject time (`IHostClock`) rather than reading a static clock, so everything stays
  deterministic and testable.

## What is safe to build next (no blockers)

1. **Visual scene model** — `Core/VisualModel/` (`VisualScene`/`Bank`/`Macro`/`Layer`,
   quantized launch state machine). Uses `IBeatTimeline`/`BeatQuantizer`. (doc 08)
2. **Autopilot rule engine** — `Core/Autopilot/` (show-rules state machine, override/auto-resume).
   Uses Beat + Actions. (doc 10)
3. **Live playlist queue** — `Core/Playlist/` Now/Next/Later over the existing builder. (doc 09)
4. **More concern handlers** for the dispatcher as their engines appear.

## Blocked until the audio-library decision (BASS vs PortAudio/miniaudio)

- `IAudioSource` realtime playback, decks + mixer (doc 11), the audio frame pipeline (doc 02),
  and therefore audio-driven beat detection (doc 03 realtime half).
